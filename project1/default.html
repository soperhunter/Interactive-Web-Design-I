        <h2>Preface/Background</h2>

        <p>
            My name is Hunter Soper, and while I have (nor desire) any kind of professional cooking experience, I absolutely love to bake and cook as much as i can.
            I've always had a love for the sciences, and baking is just simple math with some basic science where you get to eat something tasty at the end. I had a
            lot of role models when i was younger who cooked, so i just ended up learning from good people and picking it up over time. I generally like to bake more
            than cooking, mainly because i'm a very picky eater when it comes to savory, but i love anything when it comes to sweet. Today, I try to bake new things
            all time time; usually i'll just bring what I cook into work for feedback. <br /><br />
            While I try to bake/cook new things frequently, I've sort of build up a little cookbook of things that i really enjoy cooking/eating. I generally look at a few recipies online when i 
            want to make something new. I'll find common elements over a few recipies, and i like to look at all the comments to see common modifications people make. Of course, after you make something a time or two
            you begin to learn what modifications YOU want to make to enjoy it the most.
